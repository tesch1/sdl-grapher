This is a small C library written in SDL to aid in the creation of 2D graphs, 3D "graphs" (using two dimensions and color), animation of graphs, etc. Everything is done through one structure, with helping functions that do the work.

The programmer will most likely not need to program any SDL code, but only need to program the math, and use the library functions to print to the screen.
